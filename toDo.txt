make sur that the software can store many url and then many traduction (it can't yet)
allow for many different video on the same page
add a button that reload the script on the page -- not necessary, it already check for new video every 5 sec until it find a video... maybe refresh it anyway after the first video is traduced to check for new video?

Maybe we could replace speechrecognition directly by pocketsphinx?
The build take 5 minutes ->
